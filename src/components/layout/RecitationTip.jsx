        🌱 Reciting doesn’t cost anything, and you don’t need to set aside a big
        chunk of time.

      <p>
        If you haven’t memorized it yet, no worries — just follow along with the
        audio or video. <strong>Recite with it 🗣️, not just listen 🎧</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can do it while waiting ⏳, driving 🚗, doing chores 🧹, cooking a
        veggie meal 🥦, or even during quiet moments at work — as long as your
        mind isn’t fully tied up.
